This is a small-terminal based project I made for fun!
It is a math game, that takes a users desired operator, and asks them five questions and tallies there score of the amount of questions they get right.

The game can be repeated multiple times, and after the user is finished playing, they can get the results of every game they played, along with the date it was played.

Thank you!
